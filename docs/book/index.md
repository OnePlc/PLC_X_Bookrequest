# oneplace-bookrequest

onePlace Book Request Module. Make request for books,
match books by defined criterias.

Example: You have a Book based "Book" Module, with a list
of Books you have. Now someone comes and asks you for a certain book.
With Book Request deployed as "Book Request" Module, you can
now make a request for lets say the book title, or ISBN, or year - 
and it will find Books that match that criteria. More than that, if a 
Request is saved, it will also match as soon as you add a Book
matching the criteria

## Installation

If you want to use it for Book, just add by composer.

```bash
$ composer require oneplace/oneplace-bookrequest
```

If you need to deploy it for your own module, follow our 
[create your own module guide](https://docs.1plc.ch/oneplace-book/create-module/)
to make your own fork of Book Request.

As long as you are compatible to Book, you should be able to
deploy your own Book Request with no coding just using the deploy scripts.
